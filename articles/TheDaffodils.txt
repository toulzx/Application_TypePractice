I wondered lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o'er vales and hills, 
When all at once i saw a crowd,A host,of golden daffodils; 
Beside the lake,beneath the trees, 
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. 
Continuous as the stars that shineAnd twinkle on the Milky Way, 
They stretched in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay: 
Ten thousand saw i at a glanceTossing their heads in sprightly dance. 
The waves beside them danced, 
but theyOut-did the sparking waves in glee: 
A Poet could not but be gayIn such a jocund company: 
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought. 
What wealth the show to me had brought: 
For oft, when on my couch i lieIn vacant or in pensive mood, 
They flash upon that inward eye. 
Which is the bliss of solitude; 
And then my heart with pleasure fills,And dances with the daffodils.
